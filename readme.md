  Nitpicks - Current time text has too much margin right and the font color is darker than the Figma.
  
  All the fonts look slightly different from the figma. 
  The current weather has to be all lowercase.
  The vertical line need more margin between High and Low.

  NavBar - Extends to the top in the figma it comes from the Navbar down
  Your Favorites doesn't down the State/Country

  Wrong Search modal - Looks PERFECT. Really good job.

  Search Function works amazingly.

  The background doesn't switch to the moon when you click on the sun.

  Overall the weather application looks spot on and works properly.
